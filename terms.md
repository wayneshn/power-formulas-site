# Terms of Service for Power Formulas

These terms of service outline the rules and regulations for the use of Power Formulas's Website (“Website”) and the Power Formulas Google Workspace add-on (“Service”).

By accessing this Website and using the Service we assume you accept these terms of service in full. Do not continue to use Power Formulas's Website or Service if you do not accept all of the terms of service stated on this page.

## For the Power Formulas Add-on

We make the following commitment to our Google Workspace add-on (Power Formulas) users:

1. While we do use tools to record usage analytics on our add-on for quality-improvement purposes, no personally identifiable information will be collected in our usage analytics.
2. While the add-on frequently requests permission to access the full contents of users’ Google Sheets, this is generally because the Apps Script development framework offers us no workable alternative of more limited scope. These access rights are required to allow actions performed by the end user, and in no case are the textual contents of users’ Sheets files transmitted to any 3rd party services outside of the user’s direct control or knowledge. Other than the case of creating new files for the user in their Sheets, our tools only access the file from which the script or Add-on is launched.
3. We don't make any claim to the intellectual property of the users of our add-on.

## Work with APIs
This section will cover how to use Logic Sheet's API-related functions.

### Pull from an API

[![API screenshot](./img/fss-api.png)](./img/fss-api.png)

**Method:** Chose the http method to pull data from an API endpoint. Currently we only support the GET and POST methods, though we will add more. Please check your API reference to decide which method you want to use.

**API url:** Type in the url and full path of the API endpoint, including all parameters. Parameters are usually used to pass in API keys for simple authentication methods.

For example: https://mydata.com/api/v2/dataset1?para1=value1&api_key=keyvalue

**Headers** Headers let you pass additional information with the API request. Request headers can be used in the request to provide information about the request context to help the server tailor the response. You can use, for example, the Authorization header to provide authentication credentials.

If the server responded with a 401 Unauthorized status, usually you should provide credentials to authenticate the request. To do so, you will need to use the Authorization header.

The value of the the Authorization header should be :

    <type> <credentials>

_Common types_:
- Basic: Base64-encoded credentials.
- Bearer: Bearer tokens to access OAuth 2.0-protected resources

**Path:** If provided, the funtion will only retrieve data that is located in the path. For example, You can enter key1.key2[1].key3 to retrieve to value of key3 of the second object of array key2 of the object key1.

If the JSON response looks like this:

    {
        "id": 1001,
        "person": [
            {
                "name": "John",
                "age": 45,
                "city": "New York"
            },
            {
                "name": "Rich",
                "age": 34,
                "city": "London"
            }
        ]
    }

the path person[1].name will return "Rich", while the path person[0] will return all information about John.

**Request body:** Enter the JSON format request body. This will only apply to the POST method. For example, when creating a resource using POST, the request body usually contains the representation of the resource to be created.

### Enrich with an API

**Column number:** Type in the number of column of the data to be processed. For example, column C should be 3.

**Start row:** Type in the number of the start row of the data to be processed.

This function will only process a column of data, so you have to choose which column and from which row you want the data to be processed. This is an example:

[![example of a data column](./img/column-row-1.png)](./img/column-row-1.png)

**Method:** Chose the http method to send data to an API endpoint. Currently we only support the GET and POST methods, though we will add more. Please check your API reference to decide which method you want to use.

**API url:** Type in the url and full path of the API endpoint, including all parameters. Parameters are usually used to pass in API keys for simple authentication methods.

You can also include {%raw%}{{merge_tag}}{%endraw%} in the url parameters to represent data from the sheet to be sent to the API endpoint. 

For example: https://mydata.com/api/v2/dataset1?api_key=keyvalye&data={%raw%}{{merge_tag}}{%endraw%}

**Headers** Headers let you pass additional information with the API request. Request headers can be used in the request to provide information about the request context to help the server tailor the response. You can use, for example, the Authorization header to provide authentication credentials.

If the server responded with a 401 Unauthorized status, usually you should provide credentials to authenticate the request. To do so, you will need to use the Authorization header.

The value of the the Authorization header should be :

    <type> <credentials>

_Common types_:
- Basic: Base64-encoded credentials.
- Bearer: Bearer tokens to access OAuth 2.0-protected resources

**Path:** If provided, the funtion will only retrieve data that is located in the path. For example, You can enter key1.key2[1].key3 to retrieve to value of key3 of the second object of array key2 of the object key1.

If the JSON response looks like this:

    {
        "id": 1001,
        "person": [
            {
                "name": "John",
                "age": 45,
                "city": "New York"
            },
            {
                "name": "Rich",
                "age": 34,
                "city": "London"
            }
        ]
    }

the path person[1].name will return "Rich", while the path person[0] will return all information about John.

**Request body:** Enter the JSON format request body. This will only apply to the POST method. For example, when creating a resource using POST, the request body usually contains the representation of the resource to be created. use {%raw%}{{merge_tag}}{%endraw%} to represent data from the sheet to be sent to the API endpoint. 

For example:

    {
        "data": {%raw%}{{merge_tag}}{%endraw%},
        "process": true
    }

## Data analysis

Logic Sheet can be used to perform all kinds of data analysis tasks, including ANOVA, or Analysis of variance, correlation, covariance, and descriptive statistics.

### One-way ANOVA

One-way ANOVA, or single factor ANOVA, is used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of several unrelated groups.

[![One-way ANOVA](./img/ss-anova-one.png)](./img/ss-anova-one.png)

**Input range:** Select the input range of your data. A range represents a single cell or a group of adjacent cells in your spreadsheet. For example, A1:D10 is shown below.

[![Data range example in Google Spreadsheets](./img/range-example-a1-d10.png)](./img/range-example-a1-d10.png)

**Grouped by:** Choose how the data is grouped, it can either be in columns or in rows. 

**Data include labels:** Check this if the input range you have selected includes data labels. Please make sure you don't include non-numeric cells if you uncheck this box.

**Alpha value:** Alpha(α), or the significance level, is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. For example, an alpha value of 0.05 means that a 5% risk of concluding that a difference exists when there is no actual difference. In ANOVA, alpha value is used to calculate the F crit value in the output.

**Output range:** Set the _cell range_ from which the ANOVA table will be displayed. Make sure there is enough space for output data. For example: A12. The output will take at least 15 rows and 7 columns. It could be larger depending on the size of the input. (See example above)

### Two-way ANOVA without replication

Two-way ANOVA, or two-factor ANOVA, is used to analyze the difference between the means of more than two groups. It is also used to estimate how two independent variables, in combination, affect a dependent variable.

[![Two-way ANOVA](./img/ss-anova-two.png)](./img/ss-anova-two.png)

**Input range:** Select the input range of your data. A range represents a single cell or a group of adjacent cells in your spreadsheet. For example, A1:D10 is shown below.

For example, an alpha value of 0.05 means that a 5% risk of concluding that a difference exists when there is no actual difference. In ANOVA, alpha value is used to calculate the F crit value in the output.

**Output range:** Set the _cell range_ from which the ANOVA table will be displayed. Make sure there is enough space for output data. For example: A12. The output will take at least 17 rows and 7 columns. It could be larger depending on the size of the input. (See example above)

## Correlation

Correlation is used to find the correlation coefficient between two or more variables.

[![Correlation](./img/ss-correlation.png)](./img/ss-correlation.png)

**Input range:** Select the input range of your data. A range represents a single cell or a group of adjacent cells in your spreadsheet. For example, A1:D10 is shown below.

[![Data range example in Google Spreadsheets](./img/range-example-a1-d10.png)](./img/range-example-a1-d10.png)

**Grouped by:** Choose how the data is grouped, it can either be in columns or in rows. 

**Data include labels:** Check this if the input range you have selected includes data labels. Please make sure you don't include non-numeric cells if you uncheck this box.

**Output range:** Set the _cell range_ from which the correlation results will be displayed. Make sure there is enough space for output data. For example: A12. The output will take at least 3 rows and 3 columns. It could be larger depending on the size of the input. (See example above)

### Covariance

The Covariance tool quantifies the relationship between two sets of values.

[![Correlation](./img/ss-covariance.png)](./img/ss-covariance.png)

**Input range:** Select the input range of your data. A range represents a single cell or a group of adjacent cells in your spreadsheet. For example, A1:D10 is shown below.

[![Data range example in Google Spreadsheets](./img/range-example-a1-d10.png)](./img/range-example-a1-d10.png)

**Data include labels:** Check this if the input range you have selected includes data labels. Please make sure you don't include non-numeric cells if you uncheck this box.

**Output range:** Set the _cell range_ from which the covariance results will be displayed. Make sure there is enough space for output data. For example: A12. The output will take at least 3 rows and 3 columns. It could be larger depending on the size of the input. (See example above)

## Descriptive statistics

Descriptive statistics describe the basic features of the data. Features include Mean, Standard Error, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation, Sample Variance, Kurtosis, Skewness, Range, Confidence Level, and more.

[![Descriptive statistics](./img/ss-descriptive.png)](./img/ss-descriptive.png)

**Input range:** Select the input range of your data. A range represents a single cell or a group of adjacent cells in your spreadsheet. For example, A1:D10 is shown below.

**Kth Largest:** Returns the k'th largest number in the given group of numbers. For example, if the group of numbers are [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15], and when Kth Largest = 3, the output will be 10.

**Kth Largest:** Returns the k'th smallest number in the given group of numbers. For example, if the group of numbers are [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15], and when Kth Largest = 3, the output will be 7.

**Confidence Level for Mean:**  The confidence level represents the theoretical long-run frequency (i.e., the proportion) of confidence intervals that contain the true value of the unknown population parameter. For example, 90% of confidence intervals computed at the 90% confidence level contain the parameter, 95% of confidence intervals computed at the 95% confidence level contain the parameter. The confidence level is selected before examining the data. Most commonly, a 95% confidence level is used.
